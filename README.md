# QLStats-Discord
QLStats is a website that displays data from matches in Quake Live and the bot is a basic PUG bot that allows PUG'ers in different Quake Live modes to get pre-shuffled teams and much more.

### Commands
**!a(dd)** - Allows you to add into the PUG queue.
**!r(emove** - Removes you from the PUG queue.
**!w(ho)** - Displays who is currently in the PUG queue.
**!elo** - Grabs ELO of a registered player in the database.
**!mode** - Shows what mode the bot is configured for.
**!h(elp)** - General Help that displays all of the commands.
**!create** - Creates an account in the database to record your ELO.
**!v(ersion)** - Displays the changelog as well as the version of the bot.

### Admin Commands
**!server** - Shows what server the bot is configured for.
**!qlstats** - Allows you to toggle the QLStats on & off. Turning it off disables the requirement to use !create and doesn't give ELO shuffled teams.
**!fakeadd** - Allows you to add fake players (only for testing purposes).
