# QLStats-Discord Minimal
This is a fork of QLStats-Discord. I have ripped out the pickup group stuff since I was interested just in the ELO functionality.

### Commands 
**!elo** - Grabs ELO of a registered player in the database.  
**!h(elp)** - General Help that displays all of the commands.  
**!create** - Creates an account in the database to record your ELO.
